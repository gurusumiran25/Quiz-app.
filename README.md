# Quiz-app.Backend (React)

This repository contains the backend implementation of a Quiz App using React with MySQL as the database. The backend manages quiz data, user authentication, and interactions with the frontend. It is built using Node.js and Express.js.

Features

*   RESTful API: Implements a REST API to handle quiz data and user authentication.
*   **MySQL Database Integration**: Utilizes MySQL for storing quiz questions, user details, and quiz results.
*   **User Authentication**: Provides user registration and login functionality using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
*   **Quiz Management**: Supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for quiz questions.
*   **Scalable Architecture**: Designed with scalability in mind using Express.js for routing and middleware management.

*   **Node.js**: Backend JavaScript runtime.
*   **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.
*   **MySQL**: Relational database management system.
*   **Sequelize**: Promise-based Node.js ORM for MySQL.
*   **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for secure authentication.
*   **bcrypt**: Library for hashing passwords securely.

Getting Started

    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `cd quiz-app-backend npm install`
    
3.  **Set Environment Variables**:
    
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and specify the following variables:
    
    plaintext
    
    Copy code
    
    `PORT=3000 DB_HOST=localhost DB_USER=your_mysql_username DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password DB_NAME=quiz_app JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret`
    
4.  **Start the Server**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `npm start`
